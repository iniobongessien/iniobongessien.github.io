I am a social psychologist studying how intergroup processes are shaped by the contexts in which they occur. My research examines how the social makeup of places influences their perception, how the composition of school settings affects teachers’ judgments and decisions, and how intergroup bias varies across regions.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Professorship for Social and Organisational Psychology of Social Work at Leuphana University Lüneburg, Germany, where my work focuses on the social and structural dynamics of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. In recognition of this work, I received the [Leuphana Gender and Diversity Award 2022–2023](https://www.leuphana.de/universitaet/termine/dies-academicus/dies-academicus-2025.html#c819294) (Leuphana Sonderpreis für Geschlechter- und Diversitätsforschung) for outstanding achievements in diversity research.

I currently co-direct the project [Constructive Diversity Talk for Prospective Teachers (KoDiTa)](https://www.leuphana.de/en/institutes/ifsp/research-projects/kodita.html), which develops and evaluates a higher education program that aims to prepare future teachers to engage constructively in conversations about diversity. From 2021 to 2023, I led a research project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) on [context-based discrimination in school discipline](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/466464566?language=en).
