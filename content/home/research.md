My research focuses on intergroup relations, covering social identity and stigmatization, prejudice, stereotyping (e.g., stereotyping in educational contexts; space-focused stereotypes), implicit social cognition, and automatic influences of stereotypes on behavior. My research has been published in the _European Journal of Social Psychology_, _Journal of Experimental Social Psychology_, and _Journal of Personality and Social Psychology_ amongst others.
